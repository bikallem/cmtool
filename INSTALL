The CM tools are implemented in Standard ML.  For Unix and Windows
platforms, there are build scripts using the MLton and Standard ML of
New Jersey compilers.

0. Install either MLton or Standard ML of New Jersey.

1. Build CM-Lex

   cd lex
   make                  # this will just display the build options

   make mlton            # build using MLton
   OR
   make smlnj            # build using SML/NJ on Unix platforms
   OR
   make win+smlnj        # build using SML/NJ on Windows+Cygwin

   bin/cmlex             # check to make sure it built
   mv bin/cmlex <location where you want cmlex installed>
   cd ..

2. Build CM-Yacc

   cd yacc
   make                  # this will just display the build options

   make mlton            # build using MLton
   OR
   make smlnj            # build using SML/NJ on Unix platforms
   OR
   make win+smlnj        # build using SML/NJ on Windows+Cygwin

   bin/cmyacc            # check to make sure it built
   mv bin/cmyacc <location where you want cmyacc installed>
   cd ..

Note: When using the SML/NJ compiler, the file you moved was a script
that loads a binary image using an absolute path name.  If you delete
or move the cmtool directory, that script will no longer work.
