The CM tools are implemented in Standard ML (including the Haskell
versions of the tools.)  For Unix platforms, there are build scripts
usng the MLton and Standard ML of New Jersey compilers.  For Windows
platforms, there are build scripts using Standard ML of New Jersey
compiler.

0. Install either MLton or Standard ML of New Jersey.

1. Build CM-Lex for Standard ML

   cd lex
   make                  # this will just display the build options

   make mlton            # build using MLton on Unix platforms
   OR
   make smlnj            # build using SML/NJ on Unix platforms
   OR
   make win+smlnj        # build using SML/NJ on Windows+Cygwin

   bin/cmlex             # check to make sure it built
   mv bin/cmlex <location where you want cmlex installed>
   cd ..

2. Build CM-Lex for Haskell

   cd lex
   make                  # this will just display the build options

   make mlton+hs         # build using MLton on Unix platforms
   OR
   make smlnj+hs         # build using SML/NJ on Unix platforms
   OR
   make win+smlnj+hs     # build using SML/NJ on Windows+Cygwin

   bin/cmlex-hs          # check to make sure it built
   mv bin/cmlex-hs <location where you want cmlex-hs installed>
   cd ..

3. Build CM-Yacc for Standard ML

   cd yacc
   make                  # this will just display the build options

   make mlton            # build using MLton on Unix platforms
   OR
   make smlnj            # build using SML/NJ on Unix platforms
   OR
   make win+smlnj        # build using SML/NJ on Windows+Cygwin

   bin/cmyacc            # check to make sure it built
   mv bin/cmyacc <location where you want cmyacc installed>
   cd ..

4. Build CM-Yacc for Haskell

   cd yacc
   make                  # this will just display the build options

   make mlton+hs         # build using MLton on Unix platforms
   OR
   make smlnj+hs         # build using SML/NJ on Unix platforms
   OR
   make win+smlnj+hs     # build using SML/NJ on Windows+Cygwin

   bin/cmyacc-hs         # check to make sure it built
   mv bin/cmyacc-hs <location where you want cmyacc-hs installed>
   cd ..


Note: When using the SML/NJ compiler, the file you moved was a script
that loads a binary image using an absolute path name.  If you delete
or move the cmtool directory, that script will no longer work.
